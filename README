PURPOSE:

A folder to save cross system configuration files. 

USAGE:

Make symbolic links in your home folder to the files in this folder. Example:
ln -sfn /home/mydaum/config/.!(|.)* -t /home/mydaum

You might need to delete folders in the target (-t) directory if 'ln' gives an error. Also you might not want .git in your home directory as this is the local configuration git repositry.
